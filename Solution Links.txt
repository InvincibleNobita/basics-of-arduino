Statement 1
Make a Column of 12 Bulb and number them from 1 to 12 from left to right. Glow the Odd
Bulbs for 1 second (even will be off) and then even for 1 second (odd will be off) and this will
be continued in loop until simulation is turned off.
1 to 12 led will glow in even and odd pattern
0,2,4,6 â€¦. Even number leds will glow at first for 1 seconds
Then 1 second pause where every led will be off
